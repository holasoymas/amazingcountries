Iranians use their own calendar which is a solar calendar,
 meaning that its time reckoning is based on the Earth's 
 movements around the Sun. The first day of the year is the
  first day of spring and it is called Nowrouz. The first 6 
  months have 31 days, the following 5 months have 30 days and
   the last month normally has 29 days but 30 days
    in leap years.
