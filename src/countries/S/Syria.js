Damascus is widely believed to be one of the oldest continuously
 inhabited cities in the world, with evidence of habitation
  dating back to around 10,000 to 8,000 BCE. Its location and
   persistence have made the city a nexus for civilizations 
   come and gone. In 2018, its metropolitan area was home to
    about 2.3 million people, and in 2008 UNESCO named the city
     the Arab Capital of Culture.
