There is an annual pilgrimage where over 1 million West
 Africans participate in. Known as the Hajj of Senegal, Magal
  Touba is the event for Baay Fall practitioners. Each October,
   followers from all parts of West Africa will trek to the 
   illustrious religious capital of Touba and pray for their 
   founder Serigne Touba. Leading up to the event, major cities
    will host week-long festivals filled with food and praying.
     Another prominent holiday Mourids celebrate is Tabaski.
