The Arabian oryx, native to the country, was once classified
 as extinct in the wild. However, thanks to a government 
 conservation project, the species has been reintroduced in to
  the desert from captivity and is making a comeback. This is
   the only documented case in history of an extinct animal 
   being restored.
