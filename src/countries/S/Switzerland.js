Amongst industrialized nations, Switzerland has one of the
 highest rates of gun ownership. However, that does not 
 necessarily have to lead to more crime; Switzerland has
  nearly half the gun-related deaths the United States has.
   Switzerland actually has one of the lowest crime rates of
    all industrialized countries.
