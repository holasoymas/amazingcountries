In 1915, French Army was the first to create a dedicated 
camouflage unit in 1915. Guns and vehicles were painted by
 artists called camofleurs. The following year, the British
  Army followed suit and established its own camouflage 
  section under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis
   Wyatt. It was known as the Special Works Park RE 
   (Royal Engineers).
