Every last Saturday of every month from 8am to 11am people
 nationwide participate in community projects. It's known as
  Umuganda and its mandatory. People all over the country take
   part in cleaning the streets, helping to build schools, 
   cutting grass, etc. The idea behind this practice is not 
   only to keep everything clean and tidy, but also to help 
   unite people after the Genocide.
