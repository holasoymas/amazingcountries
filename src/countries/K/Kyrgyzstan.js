Epic of Manas is the longest poem in history. Weighing in at
 a whopping 500,000 lines, this epic poem about the life of
  the warrior Manas is 20 times longer than The Odyssey. Most 
  records date the piece to the 18th century, though the
   Kyrgyz people claim it is much older, an oral tale that
    was passed down until it was recorded in writing in the
     1700s. The first complete version was published in 1920.
