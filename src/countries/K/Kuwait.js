"Kuwait" is derived from an Arabic word meaning fort. Until
 the 18th century, Kuwait hardly had any settlements but
  the area was visited by nomads who would come and go.
   However, when drought struck the desert area that the
    nomads depended on for their survival, they started 
    settling down near the coast of the Persian Gulf in what
     is today Kuwait. They fortified settlements in the area
      from where the name Kuwait was derived.
