Kazakhstan has a space launch facility. And not just any space
 launch facility, but the world's first and largest. Tim 
 Peake will be following in the footsteps of other famous
  astronauts when his rocket takes off from the Baikonur
   Cosmodrome in the Kazakh desert. The site, built in the
    1950s for the Soviet Union, is where Sputnik 1 took off.
     The facility is currently leased by the Russians and 
     remains at the centre of its space programme.
