Denmark is home to the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken,
 as well as the second oldest one, Tivoli Gardens. People 
 originally came to Bakken to drink from the healing spring
  during the summer. Later visitors began erecting tents and
   stalls to entertain and sell items. Over time, it became
