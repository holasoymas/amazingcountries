 CAR counts a myriad of armed groups and militias. It is 
 estimated that armed groups and militias run up to 80 % 
 of the territory, challenging the authority of the central
  government everywhere they operate. The presence of armed
   groups has prevented many internally displaced people from
    returning to their homes.
