 The oldest known deliberate mummy is a child, one of the
  Chinchorro mummies found in the Camarones Valley in Chile
   around 5050 BC. So far a total of 282 Chinchorro mummies
    have been removed from burial sites along the narrow 
    coastal strip from Ilo in southern Peru to Antofagasta in
     northern Chile. Of these, 149 were created by Chinchorro
      artisans, and the rest were the work of nature.
