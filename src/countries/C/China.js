  China despite geographically spanning over 5 time zones,
   only uses one standard time. All 5 time zones were in use
    during the Republic of China from 1912 to 1949, but since
     then China has decided to use just one standard time. The 
     time in China follows a single standard time offset of 
     UTC+08:00 (eight hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time).
