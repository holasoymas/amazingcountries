Cock fighting is an official sport in Haiti. Animal rights
 activists in the U.S. denounce the activity as cruel and 
 inhumane, but in Haiti, the popularity of Cock Fighting 
 skyrockets. Raw meat and hot pepper soaked in rum is fed to
  cocks to make them tough and aggressive and the owner of 
  the winning cock wins $70 which is what more than 80% of 
  Haitians earn in a month, making it very lucrative.
