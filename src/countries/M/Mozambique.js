Mozambique was governed from Goa until 1752, when it was
 brought under direct control from Lisbon. As a result of this
  link with India, numerous Indians trading communities 
  settled in the country, and their influence can still be 
  seen today. Independent Arab trading 'states' survived until
   the end of the 19th century.
