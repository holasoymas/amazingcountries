 The Kingdom of Morocco is also known as the Land of the
  Berbers because roughly 40% of the population are, well,
   Berbers.Descendants of the first inhabitants of Morocco,
    the Berbers have a very colorful and nature-driven culture.
     A large chunk of them prefer to live in the harshest 
     condition possible, like the High Atlas Mountains or the
      Sahara Desert.
