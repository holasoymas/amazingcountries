The Darvaza gas crater or most commonly referred to as 
"Gates of Hell" it is actually the result of a mistake made by
 a group of Soviet geologists who were drilling for natural 
 gas in 1971. After their equipment and transport fell into 
 the hole and gas began escaping, they opted to light it on 
 fire, imagining it would take only a few days to burn off. 
 Considering that the crater still burns over 48 years later,
  you could say their calculation of available subterranean 
  gas was a bit off.
