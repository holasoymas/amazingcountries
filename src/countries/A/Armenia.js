       Armenia was the first conutry to adopt  Chiristanity.
        Christianity spread to the now-defunct Kingdom of Armenia
        soon after the death of Jesus, though it took until the
        early 4th century for it to be adopted as the state religion.
        Still, that was earlier than any other country on the planet."
