Georgia has almost every type of climate, from subtropical and
 alpine to semi-desert, but its land is also conducive to
  agriculture, with 49 different types of soil. This makes the
   Georgian biosphere one of the most ecologically diverse on
    earth. Though a wide variety of species can be found all 
    over the country, dense forests cover 43% and are populated
     by animals such as lynxes, bears and a small number of
      leopards."
